# SpatialTME
Spatial Tumor Microenvironment (SpatialTME) database is a comprehensive database designed to characterize tumor spatial microenvironment. SpatialTME collected 296 slides with spatial transcriptomics based on 10X Genomics Visium or Slide-seq covering 19 cancer types and provides convenient tools to help users explore spatial TME, including six modules: spatial structure, spatial gene expression, spatial differential expression, spatial cell pattern, gene expression profile at sub-spot level, and cell interaction analysis.
